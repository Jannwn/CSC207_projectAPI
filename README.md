## Example out put of running your Java code:
 There are two sample java code we created trying to use the api of evernote and onenote, but it is a little bit difficult for us to set up the environment.
 Problems:
 *(Prerequisites are for a limited time this week)*
 1.use maven or gradle to include the SDK to the project 
 2.sign up for the APIKey correctly
## Another example of tryin to use the cloud drive API
1. google-drive provides a platform on which we can upload our files.
