## Example out put of running your Java code:
 There are two sample java code we created trying to use the api of evernote and onenote, but it is a little bit difficult for us to set up the environment.
 Problems:
 *(Prerequisites are for a limited time this week)*
 1.use maven or gradle to include the SDK to the project 
 2.sign up for the APIKey correctly
## Another example of tryin to use the cloud drive API
1. google-drive provides a platform on which we can upload our files.

2. ddowload provides the apis on their website which provides us some ideas of how to structure our cloud drive.

* this shows the supporting app maven it needs (however i met some problems with that because I can't find the path variable)
![img_3.png](img_3.png)
* this shows the total API given (too big, so I didn't attach files to our current project)

## A list of any technical problems blocking progress (if any):
1.Tried to get the access_token of onenote following some steps searched on the Internet, but stuck here because of limited time and authority.
